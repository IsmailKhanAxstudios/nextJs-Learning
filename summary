perfect i got everything i want to revise all nextjs provides better SEO by metadata 
which can be exported directly on each routes , it has diffrent rendering such as static
site generation which fetches data before the initial build and prerendedred we use getStaticprop 
to perfoem operations and get data in that component using prop it is used for static content that 
does not require interaction . second is server side generation which fetches data on every request whenever
user hits that page it fetches data and it is done using getserver side oprops we can use with data that changes
frequyently and initially all compoentns are ssr and another is client side rendering we can use it for non seo critical
task normaly it is fetched in useEffect and add dependency. it all increases the performance ,another is isr which is excyetd
after interval of time it uses getstaticprop with revalidate timer, next js als oprovided image optimisation and code splitting , 
nextjs also supports backend logic which can be written in app folder and each file becomes api route. rate me out of 10 my knmwodlege
for nextjs wwe can also use muddle wear for authentication in nextjs and in nextjs if its app router latest one we have index which have the initial 
comoonentst and export metadata on top we have one laoyouyt for 
everything but if we want to change we can add layoyts for specific pages. also nextjs supports dynamic routing with [] .
